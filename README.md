## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add curves to separate particular sections of the website. It creates a beautiful transition and looks excellent.

```css
  .proud-of-this-CSS {
    height: 60px;
    width: 100%;
    border-radius: 0 0 100% 100%;
    background-color: var(--dark-purple);
  }
```
